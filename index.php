<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] === "POST") {
    // Process the form data here
    $firstName = $_POST["f_name"];
    $lastName = $_POST["l_name"];
    $email = $_POST["email"];
    $phone = $_POST["phone"];
    $phone2 = $_POST["phone2"];
    $pixelId = $_POST["pixel_id"];
    $pageLang = $_POST["page_lang"];
    $query = $_POST["query"];
    $gpId = $_POST["gp_id"];
    $hsId = $_POST["hs_id"];
    $countryCode = $_POST["countryCode"];

    // You can perform further actions with the data, such as storing it in a database, sending emails, etc.
    
    // For demonstration purposes, let's simply send a response.
    echo "Thank you, $firstName! Your form data has been processed.";
} else {
    // Handle non-POST requests, or provide an error message.
    echo "Invalid request method.";
}
?>
In this example, we first check if the request method is POST using $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"]. If it's a POST request, we retrieve the form data using $_POST. You can then process and use this data as needed. For example, you could store it in a database, send confirmation emails, or take any other actions your application requires.

Finally, we provide a simple response to the user. You would typically customize this script to suit the specific needs of your web application, such as connecting to a database, validating user input, and more.
